# Import Instructions

I'm attaching the BSD new student file that needs to be updated in to DonorPerfect.  

Please note the following legend for the data from BSD:

Codes Legend:
```
 E - New Enrollment
 R - Returning
TK - Transitional Kindergarten
 M - Immersion
 H - Hosted
IN - InterDistrict
 T - Intra District
```

> GREEN is used on preregistered= new families, and YELLOW and BLUE are used to highlight two or more students in the same family.

Some guidelines for updating the data:

- Update all students to their new grade for 2016-17 year.
- Graduate all outgoing 8th graders from the system (set the school ="Graduated from BSD" and grade="Alum").

Identify existing families:

- Update student information particularly if they have changed school.
- Add any new students to the existing families
- Update any students who are no longer in BSD (set school="No Longer in BSD").
- If possible, update the address of existing donor/families if they have moved.
- If possible, update any email changes. 

Enter students for NEW families:

- Create a new donor record and set DONOR TYPE to Individual.
- Enter Husband's Name (usually parent1) as the donor name.
- Wife's name (usually Parent2) should be in the Spouse Name on the donor record.
- Optional Line (OPT LINE) should be set to the full wife's name (ie. Susie Smith)
- Salutation (SALUTATION) should be set to husband's name first and then the wife's name.  Ie, Jack and Susie Smith.  Or if the last names are different, Jack Jones and Susie Smith.
- Informal Saluatation (INFORMAL_SAL) should be set to the husband's and the wife's first names only.  Always put the husband's name first.  ie. Jack and Susie.
- FY_JOIN_BSD should be set to SY2016-17 for any new families joining BSD this year.
- Set guardian (GUARDIAN) and guardian email (GUARD_EMAIL) fields if they exist in BSD data.
- Set Receipt Delivery (RECEIPT_DELIVERY) to Email (E) for all new donor record.
- If the husband's email does not exist, put the wife's email in the EMAIL field.  We need something in that field.
- The Incoming student list MAY contain students returning to BSD and we may already have a donor record for these students.  Check before creating new donor records.

> Some students will have changed schools.  Please update the student record with the correct school designation.

> If a student is no longer in BSD (not in the Current student list nor in the incoming list), update their School to "NOBSD" -- No longer in BSD.
> A student record may be associated with multiple donor records if the parents are divorced.  Be sure to update all parent records when modifying a student record.

Please let me know when you need people to be off of the system to perform your task.  I can send out a reminder to all about staying off the system while the data is being updated.  Make sure to take backups!
